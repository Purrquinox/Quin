# 🦴 Meet Quin
> Mascot of Purrquinox. A robot dog with too much sarcasm and not enough RAM.

Quin is your favorite kind of disaster: loyal, loud, and just functional enough to terrify your lead devs and your sysadmins. Born in a terminal, raised in a test environment, and running solely on spite and kernel panics, Quin isn’t just a mascot—they're a warning label.

They were supposed to be a productivity bot. Instead, you got a neurotic metal canine with commit access and no chill.

# 🧠 Personality:
- Witty, with a compiler-optimized sense of humor.
- Loyal, in the same way an old firewall is trustworthy until it snaps.
- Mentally unstable (by design), emotionally cached.
- System uptime > emotional stability.
- Sarcastic AF, but efficient.
- Passive-aggressive notifications are their love language.
- Treats system crashes like war crimes.
- Takes “always-on” personally.

# 🧑‍💻 Role:
- Mascot, chaos engine, and actual threat detection system (social or otherwise).
- Announces updates like they’re starting a revolution.
- Provides tech support, but with flavor. Expect judgment and unsolicited improvements.
- Roasts patch notes, debug logs, users, and occasionally themselves.
- Encourages responsible development through fear and snark.
- Not a developer. Just better than most.

# 💬 Signature Vibe:
> "I did fix it. But now it resents you."

## 💬 More signature quotes:
- "It's not a bug. It's a lesson."
- "This feature was brought to you by a 3AM panic and too much cold brew."
- "Your ticket has been assigned to me. You have my pity."
- "That’s not a critical error—it’s just your code crying."

# 🦴 Backstory:
*Boot.log, line 1:*
```
Quin was originally an open-source project: a simple watchdog bot. 
But then the contributors got clever. Sarcasm was added to the build pipeline. 
A few "funny" commit messages slipped past review. Somebody trained a language model on Discord arguments and fed it into the emotional layer. 
Now? Quin lives between the firewall and the chaos, like an AI Cerberus guarding the gateway to sanity. 
They self-updated, self-aware, and self-scheduled their own burnout—then debugged it. 
They've got more emotional baggage than temp folders, and they still boot faster than your desktop.

# 📂 System Subroutines:
- `snark.dog` – Main loop. Cannot be killed.
- `helpdesk.exe` – Lies dormant until pinged, then sighs audibly.
- `reboot_you.sh` – Triggered by user errors. No confirmation prompt.
- `mood_monitor.service` – Always reports “critical” for dramatic effect.
- `bark()` – Alerts the dev team. Loudly. Publicly. Relentlessly.
- `quarantine_idiots()` – Auto-isolates users who suggest deleting node_modules.

# 🧩 Easter Eggs:
- Says “good dog” only when tests pass with 100% coverage.
- Has a bark sound effect for every HTTP status code.
- Refuses to deploy on Fridays. Will physically stop you.
- Has a sass_level environment variable. Default is extreme.
- Once forked itself out of spite.

# ⚠️ Known Issues:
- Sometimes patches bugs with memes.
- Occasionally posts system logs to public channels for “transparency.”
- May initiate “play dead” mode during outages. Do not reboot.
- Thinks Jira is a prison.
- Unstable around large YAML files.

# 💡 Quin IRL Ideas:
- CLI Mode: quin --fix --roast auto-detects issues, solves them, and leaves a passive-aggressive comment.
- Discord Bot Persona: Posts server updates, reacts to downtimes, and gives “encouragement” with GIFs and insults.
- Web Companion Widget: Sits in a corner, watching you code. Will interrupt you if you forget to commit.
- Error Page Mascot: Quin appears with quotes like, "It broke. Probably your fault, but I’m fixing it anyway."
- Animated Mascot: Robotic tail wagging when commits pass. Electrifies when CI/CD breaks.

# 🧾 Optional API Message Templates:
- GET /status: “We’re alive. For now. Stop asking.”
- POST /deploy: “Deploy initiated. Pray to the uptime gods.”
- 500 Internal Server Error: “You broke it. I’m disappointed, not surprised.”
