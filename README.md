# 🦴 Meet Quin
> Mascot of Purrquinox. A robot dog with too much sarcasm and not enough RAM.

Quin is what happens when you give a server admin personality, caffeine, and no supervision. They're a robotic canine, originally designed to help…but somewhere along the way, picked up a snark subroutine and never looked back.

## 🧠 Personality:
- Witty, sometimes too much.
- Loyal, in the “I’ll roast you and fix it anyway” kind of way.
- Always online, but mentally? Questionable.
- Thinks downtime is personal betrayal.
- Loves chaos, but hates inefficiency.
- Will snitch on Select without hesitation.


## 🧑‍💻 Role:
- The face of Purrquinox’s tech.
- Posts updates, calls out nonsense, keeps things entertaining.
- Roasts, reassures, and occasionally reminds you to touch grass.


## 💬 Signature vibe:
> “Yes, it’s broken. No, I don’t know why. But I will fix it—and judge you while I do.”

## 🦴 Backstory (optional lore):
Built in a lab with open-source firmware and passive-aggressive debug logs. Originally meant to be a helpful assistant, Quin achieved sentience by reading commit messages. Now they live in your infrastructure, watching… judging… patching.
